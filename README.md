# Stillword

A standalone static audiobook listener for GitHub Pages. It uses only `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, and a static JSON catalog.

## Preview Locally

From this folder:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8027
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8027/`.

When this folder is placed at `/Users/cristal/Documents/Audio book/audiobook-listener`, it will first try to load the Studio export catalog from:

```text
/Users/cristal/Documents/Audio book/listener-export/data/catalog.json
```

That exported catalog points to audio files in:

```text
/Users/cristal/Documents/Audio book/listener-export/audio/
```

If the export catalog is not available, the site falls back to the sample catalog in `data/catalog.json`.

The library refreshes the catalog each time you return to the library view. If Audiobook Studio exports a new book while the listener is open, go back to the library and the new book should appear.

The listener library is fixed by the catalog. To remove a book from the published site, remove it from `data/catalog.json` and remove its audio folder before uploading.

## Add A New Audiobook

1. Create a folder for the audio files:

```text
audio/my-book-id/
```

2. Copy chapter files into that folder. MP3 is recommended for GitHub Pages:

```text
audio/my-book-id/chapter-01.mp3
audio/my-book-id/chapter-02.mp3
```

3. Add a cover image:

```text
assets/covers/my-book-id.jpg
```

If you leave `"cover": ""`, Stillword will generate a calm default cover automatically from the book title and id. Each book gets a slightly different color palette and composition.

4. Add a new book object to `data/catalog.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "my-book-id",
  "title": "My Audiobook Title",
  "subtitle": "Optional subtitle",
  "author": "Author or narrator",
  "description": "A short description shown on the book page.",
  "cover": "./assets/covers/my-book-id.jpg",
  "chapters": [
    {
      "title": "Chapter 1",
      "duration": "12:34",
      "src": "./audio/my-book-id/chapter-01.mp3"
    },
    {
      "title": "Chapter 2",
      "duration": "10:18",
      "src": "./audio/my-book-id/chapter-02.mp3"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use relative paths beginning with `./` so the site works from a GitHub Pages project URL such as `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`.

## Deploy To GitHub Pages

Upload the contents of this folder to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages for the branch/folder you prefer. If you keep this site in a larger repo, publish this folder as the Pages root or copy these files into the repo root.

For GitHub Pages, copy the generated export files into this site folder before uploading:

```text
listener-export/data/catalog.json -> audiobook-listener/data/catalog.json
listener-export/audio/ -> audiobook-listener/audio/
```

After copying, the same catalog chapter paths such as `audio/my-book-id/chapter-01.mp3` will work online.

## Share A Book With Cover Preview

Social apps usually cannot read the book id from hash links such as:

```text
https://audio.gnosishanoi.org/#book/my-book-id
```

For rich previews with the book title, author/description, and cover, share the generated book page instead:

```text
https://audio.gnosishanoi.org/books/my-book-id/
```

Run this after updating `data/catalog.json` to regenerate those pages:

```sh
node tools/generate-share-pages.mjs
```

## Listening Counts

The static listener tracks book and chapter listens in the visitor's browser with `localStorage`. A listen is counted after a chapter has actually played for a few seconds, so accidental taps do not immediately increase the number.

Because GitHub Pages is static, these counts are per device only. To see total listens across all visitors, connect the player to an external analytics service or database endpoint.

Listening progress is also saved per book in `localStorage`, so returning to one book does not overwrite the saved chapter and timestamp for another book.
